projects:
  - title: AI Lawyer Chatbot
    abstract: Research and prototyping of German LLM using RLHF in multi-node, multi-GPU environment
    description: >
      Research and prototyping for an instruction-based, German LLM using RLHF, capable of:
      - Understanding legal cases
      - Identying applicable legal contexts
      - Autonomously asking questions to obtain information relevant to the claim
      This project included mult-node, multi-GPU training of LLMs on AWS & Azure. 
      Throughout this project I had to read, comprehend, and implement multiple 
      state-of-the-art Machine Learning papers.

      Enhancement of LLM text generation using contextual information to enable personalized,
      fact-based chatbot interactions.
    description: >
      I have developed multiple Information Retrieval pipelines that utilize a vectorized knowledge database 
      to enhance LLM prompts, such as those used in ChatGPT, with contextual information, resulting in 
      personalized and fact-based chatbot interactions. These pipelines have been successfully applied to 
      various use cases, including automated communication with clients and courts, leveraging case-specific 
      information for a legaltech company. Additionally, I have created a Document query engine, as showcased 
      in a GitHub repository and a Medium blog post, which enables users to perform queries on their own 
      unstructured text databases. Both services have been deployed on AWS, utilizing terraform Infrastructure 
      as Code to ensure authentication, load balancing, and other essential features are implemented effectively.

      Training and deployment of information extraction models, 
      including Named Entity Recognition in the legal domain, using transformers 
      and OCR with MLflow on Sagemaker.
    description: >
      Training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring of information
      extraction models. In the context of the legal domain, this involves
      Named Entity Recognition (NER) of pertinent details from client,
      court, and insurance correspondence. To achieve this, I utilized
      transformers-based architectures and a BiLSTM-CRF ensemble
      model approach. Additionally, my team and I developed an Optical
      Character Recognition model to extract information from images sent
      by customers, employing a YOLOv5 + TrOCR model ensemble.
      Experiments for model training were conducted on Sagemaker and
      tracked in MLflow.

      As a Machine Learning Engineer, I’ve trained, evaluated, and
      deployed document classification models for SCAILEX and its SaaS
      platform handling 500,000+ annual documents from various sources.
      Using SWEM and transformers-based approaches, we achieved a
      60% automation rate with 95% accuracy. Model training experiments
      were conducted on Sagemaker and tracked in MLflow for efficient
      development.
